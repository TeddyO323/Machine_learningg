## Introduction

In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset containing salary information for data-related positions in different cities in India. The ultimate goal is to build a machine learning model using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm to predict salaries based on various features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Loading the Dataset

```python
# Code snippet for loading the dataset
salaries_df = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/dataset.csv")
```

### Dataset Overview

Explore the basic characteristics of the dataset, such as the number of rows, columns, and summary statistics.

### Data Visualization

Visualize key aspects of the data, including salary distributions, job title counts, and location-based information.

### Feature Engineering

Transform and preprocess features to enhance the machine learning model's performance.

## Machine Learning Model

### Data Preprocessing

Prepare the data for training the RandomForestRegressor model, including handling categorical features and splitting the dataset.

### Model Training

```python
# Code snippet for training the RandomForestRegressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Making Predictions

```python
# Code snippet for making predictions on new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({/* Your new data here */})
new_data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(new_data, columns=['Location'], drop_first=True)
predictions = model.predict(new_data_encoded)
```
